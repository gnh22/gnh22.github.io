                    <h1>Hi, I'm Grace.</h1>
                    <p>I'm a senior at the University of Pittsburgh studying Computer Science with a minor in Economics.</p>
                    <p>
                        I first started coding when I was 15 in my high school's AP Computer Science Principles course, and 
                        I fell in love with the creative freedom I saw in it. At my core, I'm just someone who enjoys learning 
                        new things for my little projects.
                    <p>
                        Over the years, this desire has manifested itself in sewing, embroidering, crocheting, and I'm using
                        this website as a reminder of how to use Computer Science as a creative outlet as well.

            <!-- <p>this is where I give an overview of some of the projects I've worked on, and also provide links to them.
                i think it would look nice if i have them in little boxes. i'll probably pick just 3 to showcase, and then
                i'll have more on my portfolio page.
